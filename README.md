**What is RUM in Data Dog ?**

In DataDog, RUM stands for Real User Monitoring. It's a feature that enables you to monitor and analyze the performance of your web applications from the perspective of your end users. RUM works by tracking various metrics, such as page load times, network requests, and user interactions directly from users' browsers. This data is then collected and analyzed to provide insights into how your application is performing for your users, helping you identify and address performance issues to improve the overall user experience.
